# Module 1 Challenge - Code Refactor Starter Code

In this challenge the customer is a company called Horiseon. This company sells services to optmize other companies visibility in internet searches and Social Midia. However, their own website needs improvements in order to attend accessibility standards and to be more visible in engine searches. 

Here are some issues that were identified and the solutions proposed:

    * Div soup - The website was all encoded using div elements which makes very hard to see its structure. Changes were made using properly the structural elements such as header, nav, section, article, div and footer.

    * Navigation wasn't working well - One of the navigation titles wasn't directing the user to the respective section because it was declared as class instead of ID.

    * Unecessary classes - The coder used one classe for each element of content even that it would have the same style for all of them, the solution was use only one class for each kinf of style which made the css file really shorter.

    * Header and Footer - The coder used a div declared as a class called header instead of use the element header of html and the same for the footer. Those divs were substituted by the corretc elements.

    * Lack of comments - Comments are very important for other coders read and understand your code properly. Some brief but instructive comments were added.

    * Title - The title was too generic which difficult searches. A new title was created.
